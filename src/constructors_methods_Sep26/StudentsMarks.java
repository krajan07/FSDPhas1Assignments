Assignment 3: create the 4 student objects with name s1,s2,s3,s4
- declare the class member variables with String name, int age, section(char type), gender (char type), and three int subject marks (subject1, subject 2, subject 3).
Calcuate the total marks and percentage obtained by every student (total= subject 1 + subject 2+ subject 3) by passing the values from the parameterized constructor. and for s2 and s3 stduents we will not pass subject 1 marks so it is 0 so dont pass it in constructor.
